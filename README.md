#Geolocation Tracker

This is Geolocation Tracker that fetches an IP address, retrieves its location details, and visualizes it on an interactive map! 
✅ Fetches public/private IP geolocation
✅ Uses multiple APIs for reliability
✅ Reverse geocoding fallback for accuracy
✅ Interactive Folium map with a custom marker

Had some debugging challenges, especially with API timeouts, but implemented a multi-source failover to ensure smooth functionality.
